# AI for Product Market Fit (PMF)

A startup is in a race to reach Product-Market Fit before the money runs out.

This document contains structured AI prompts to accelerate learning loops, validate assumptions, and reduce wasted build cycles.

## 1. Identify the Right Problems

Many startups fail because they solve problems no one cares about.

**Prompt:**
> Here is a giant CSV with 23,000 discussion group threads. Summarize the pain points people are discussing.

Goal:
- Identify recurring frustrations
- Cluster themes
- Detect emotional intensity
- Surface unmet needs

---

## 2. Test and Validate Assumptions

Every Business Model Canvas contains hidden assumptions.

**Prompt:**
> Here is the Business Model Canvas for my startup. List all the assumptions and suggest ways to test and validate each one.

Goal:
- Make assumptions explicit
- Design fast validation loops
- Reduce false certainty

---

## 3. Identify Competitive Alternatives

You compete not only with competitors — but with alternative solutions.

**Prompt:**
> Our new app helps users to [X]. List the alternative ways users could solve this same problem.

Goal:
- Identify substitutes
- Understand real competition
- Avoid Juicero-style blindness

---

## 4. Design High-Signal Customer Interviews

Most founders conduct biased interviews.

**Prompt:**
> We’re targeting [persona]. Our hypothesis is that they struggle with [problem]. Design a 15-minute interview guide that avoids pitching and maximizes signal.

Goal:
- Avoid leading questions
- Surface unexpected insights
- Challenge assumptions

---

## 5. Extract Patterns from Interview Notes

Messy qualitative data contains signal.

**Prompt:**
> Here are my interview notes from 150 customers. What patterns do you see?

Goal:
- Identify repeated language
- Detect root causes
- Separate signal from noise

---

## 6. Counter Confirmation Bias

Founders over-prioritize features they love.

**Prompt:**
> Based on the customer interviews so far, how should I prioritize features?

Goal:
- Align roadmap with validated demand
- Avoid emotional feature bias
- Focus on PMF acceleration

---

## 7. Expand the Solution Set

If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

**Prompt:**
> Here’s a problem I’ve observed. Give me five fundamentally different ways this problem could be solved.

Goal:
- Broaden thinking
- Prevent premature optimization
- Explore non-obvious approaches

---

## 8. Define Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

You likely think you know your ICP. Verify it.

**Prompt:**
> Here is all my HubSpot data and Meta campaign analytics. Based on engagement and demographic data, what is my Ideal Customer Profile?

Goal:
- Identify high-intent segments
- Align targeting and messaging
- Reduce CAC waste

---

## 9. Identify Customer Triggers

What causes someone to start looking for your solution?

**Prompt:**
> Our startup offers healthy dinners tailored to dietary or medical needs. What are the likely customer triggers?

Goal:
- Identify trigger moments
- Improve timing in acquisition
- Increase conversion probability

---

## 10. Conduct Red Team Analysis

Understand how competitors would attack you.

**Prompt:**
> Here are the websites and slide decks from my top three competitors, plus mine. How would they sell against me?

Goal:
- Identify positioning weaknesses
- Stress-test differentiation
- Prepare defensible messaging

---

## Core Principle

A startup is in a race to reach PMF before capital runs out.

AI cannot replace customer conversations or real-world testing.

But it can:
- Accelerate learning cycles
- Expose blind spots
- Surface patterns at scale
- Challenge assumptions without emotional bias

Use it as a thought partner — not a replacement for customer reality.
